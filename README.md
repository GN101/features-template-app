This is a "template" app that I intend to drop any features I develop in other personal, private apps of mine.

Features so far:

# "Fund your goal" table-app

### URL: https://crowd-funding-magic.netlify.app/

features:

1.  Provide a name of your goal, a percentage related to the funding of said goal that automatically update the table's values.
2.  Add new country in a new row (with autocomplete functionality)
3.  Edit / Delete rows.
4.  dynamic numeric input validation (transformPercentNums(), onBlurTransformPercentNums() )

### Probable future features:

1. I'll probably enhance the autocomplete functionality to allow arrow key button strokes to select the desired country result
   If you have any suggestions for any feature additions / enhancements, let me know and I'll try to implement it (assuming I find it interesting)
